To run the program you need to install android studio, click on more actions, then click on Virtual Device Manager and click on the play button of the device you would 
want to simulate. To run the code on the simulation save all the files on this Github in a folder and then open that folder in Visual Studio Code or any other code editor you're 
comfortable with. Then open the terminal in the editor and make sure the path leads to the folder. Then type npm start to run the code on the android simulation device.
